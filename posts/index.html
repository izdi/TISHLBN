<p>To me, fear of publicity correlates with my childhood environment. A small settlement Topar, 70km away from Karaganda, Kazakhstan.
Talking or writing about your thoughts in public space is something that I skip subconsciously but I feel why. This is a situation where I have to show up my skills, achievements, my self — you better watch out boy because you don&rsquo;t want troubles when the drunken father is watching.
Shut, hide, ignore, suppress emotions, don&rsquo;t talk about what&rsquo;s happening, just watch and prepare for psychological abuse. Don&rsquo;t forget that physical occasionally is going to happen as well. So next time you sleep — make sure you have a weapon under your pillow.
Don&rsquo;t explain what you feel just fight and pretend everything is normal.
Wish for better? Espace. But don&rsquo;t forget to solve your math equation 7 + 4 = don&rsquo;t know&hellip;
Don&rsquo;t remember how it felt that day, but the mental state has built a castle. Wait, who&rsquo;s this passing? Shut, hide, ignore suppress emotions. Keep it this way, that&rsquo;s safe.</p>
