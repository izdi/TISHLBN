Things I learned today, or should have learned by now.

Who am I ? I work as a software engineer at wargaming.net, doing fullstack web development.
I'm not great at writing. Most of the time I won't share some shocking stuff but this blog will be aimed at engineering, 
discovering, learning, loving (make love not war) etc.
